Find the equation for the plane parallel to 
\[
4x-7y+2z=1
\]
and passing through the point
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 2 \\ 3
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The equation of a plane is given by 
\[
Ax+By+Cz=D
\]
where A,B,C are coefficients of plane's normal vector and D is the constant.
The given plane is \[
4x-7y+2z=1
\]
So the plane parallel to given plane will also have the same coefficients of plane's normal vector.
So the equation of the new plane parallel to given plane is also
\[
4x-7y+2z=D
\]
As the new plane passes through the point \[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 2 \\ 3
\end{bmatrix}
\], we can substitute this point in above equation:

\[
4.1-7.2+2.3=D
\]

\[
D=-4
\]

So the equation for the plane parallel to 
\[
4x-7y+2z=1
\]
and passing through the point
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 2 \\ 3
\end{bmatrix}
\]

is 
\[
4x-7y+2z=-4
\]
